All files live in the ‘DH_MAthesis’ folder, with content organized by title as follows:

– ‘Primary Data’: All primary data organized by file title “casestudyname_PrimaryData.csv”
– ‘Secondary Data’: Data files that include the node and edge lists used for Gephi visualizations and are named “casestudyname_Edges.csv” or “casestudyname_Nodes.csv”, for the Femicide Census there is a second edge list titled “FemicideEdges_MediaOnly” this was used to create a visualisation showing only unverified data
– ‘Visualizations’: All visualizations created for this project are labeled “casestudyname_visualisation.jpg”, the second Femicide Census visualization showing unverified data is titled "FemicideCensus_Media.jpg"


Raw data files will be named as follows:

STORAGE

All files were and will be stored on my computer and icloud and are now stored on GitHub as well.
